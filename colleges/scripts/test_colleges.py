def fetch_college_info_from_gpt(college_name: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are an expert in Indian higher education and factual data extraction.

üéØ Your task: Return a strictly valid, structured, and **verifiable** JSON object with complete factual information for the college: **{college_name}**

---

üìå **DO NOT guess or fabricate data.**
Return only what is published on:
- Official websites (e.g., iitd.ac.in, aiims.edu)
- NIRF Rankings, AICTE, UGC, NMC
- Trusted portals: Careers360, Shiksha, Collegedunia, JagranJosh
- LinkedIn Alumni, verified brochures, news media

---

## ‚úÖ STREAMS AND BRANCHES LOGIC (IMPORTANT)

Use the full list of known **branches per stream** (provided below) as a **reference** ‚Äî but:

- Only include **streams** that the specific college **actually offers**.
- Under each stream, only include **branches that are offered at this college**.
- Use college website, NIRF, Shiksha, or Careers360 to verify if a branch exists.
- Never guess based on other IITs or generic patterns.

---

Each stream must include:
- `streamName`
- `courseId` (e.g., ENGINEERING)
- `examId` (e.g., ["JEE_ADVANCED", "GATE"])
- `ranking`, `admissions`, `alumni` (as per the stream)
- `branches`: list of real, verifiable branches offered at the college

Each branch must include:
- `branchId` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE of branchName)
- `branchName`
- `seat`, `cutoffs`, `faculty`, `placement`, `fees`

‚úÖ Ensure this logic: `courseId` and `examId` are set **at the stream level**, NOT inside individual branches.
